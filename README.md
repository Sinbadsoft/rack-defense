Rack::Defense is a Rack middleware that allows you to easily add request rate limiting and request filtering to your Rack based application (Ruby On Rails, Sinatra etc.).

* Throttling (aka rate limiting) happens on __sliding window__ using the provided period, request criteria and maximum request number. It uses Redis to track the request rate.

* Request filtering allows to reject requests based on provided critera.

Rack::Defense has a small footprint and only two dependencies: [rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) and [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb).

Rack::Defense is inspired from the [Rack::Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack) project. The main difference is the throttling algorithm: Rack::Attack uses a counter reset at the end of each period therefore allowing up to 2 times more requests than the maximum rate specified. We use a sliding window algorithm allowing a precise request rate limiting.

## Getting started

Install the rack-defense gem; or add it to you Gemfile with bundler:

```ruby
# In your Gemfile
gem 'rack-defense'
```
Tell your app to use the Rack::Defense middleware. For Rails 3+ apps:
```
# In config/application.rb
config.middleware.use Rack::Defense
```

Or for Rackup files:
```
# In config.ru
use Rack::Defense
```

Add a `rack-defense.rb` file to `config/initalizers/`:
```ruby
# In config/initializers/rack-defense.rb
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  # your configuration here
end
```

## Throttling
The Rack::Defense middleware evaluates the throttling criterias (lambadas) against the incoming request. If the return value is falsy, the request is not throttled. Otherwise, the returned value is used as a key to throttle the request. The returned key could be the request IP, user name, API token or any discriminator to throttle the requests against.

### Examples

Throttle POST requests for path `/login` with a maximum rate of 3 request per minute per IP
```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  config.throttle('login', 3, 60 * 1000) do |req|
    req.ip if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
  end
end
```

Throttle GET requests for path `/image` with a maximum rate of 50 request per second per API token
```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  config.throttle('api', 50, 1000) do |req|
    req.env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'] if %r{^/api/} =~ req.path
  end 
end
```

### Redis Configuration

Rack::Defense uses Redis to track request rates. By default, the `REDIS_URL` environment variable is used to setup the store. If not set, it falls back to host `127.0.0.1` port `6379`.
The redis store can be setup with either a connection url: 
```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  store = "redis://:p4ssw0rd@10.0.1.1:6380/15"
end
```
or directly with a connection object:
```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  store = Redis.new(host: "10.0.1.1", port: 6380, db: 15)
end
```

## Filtering

Rack::Defense can reject requests based on arbitrary properties of the request. Matching requests are filtered.

### Examples
Allow only a whitelist of ips for a given path:
```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  config.ban('ip_whitelist') do |req|
    req.path == '/protected' && !['192.168.0.1', '127.0.0.1'].include?(req.ip)
  end
end
```

Allow only requests with a known API authorization token:
```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  config.ban('allow_only_ip_list') do |req|
    %r{^/api/} =~ req.path && Redis.current.sismember('apitokens', req.env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'])
  end
end
```

## Response configuration

By default, Rack::Defense returns `429 Too Many Requests` and `403 Forbidden` respectively for throttled and banned requests. These responses can be fully configured in the setup:

```ruby
Rack::Defense.setup do |config|
  config.banned_response =
    ->(env) { [404, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ["Not Found"]] }
    
  config.throttled_response =
    ->(env) { [503, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ["Service Unavailable"]] }
  end
end
```
